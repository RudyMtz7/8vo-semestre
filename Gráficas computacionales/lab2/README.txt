Hint file. :(



/**********************************************************************

2-3 hours.



/**********************************************************************

 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

I found it difficult to translate what I learned from chapter two to the actual
concepts required to build the circle. Maybe a more concrete example would have
helped in order to land the idea sooner.
